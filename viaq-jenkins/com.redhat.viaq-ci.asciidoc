== Exported Fields

This document describes the fields that are exported by Com.Redhat.Viaq-Ci. They are
grouped in the following categories:

* <<exported-fields-_default_>>
* <<exported-fields-jenkins_data>>

[[exported-fields-_default_]]
=== Common logging metadata for CI Fields

Contains common fields, corresponds to mappings of the _default_. This mapping represents generic Jenkins configuration.



==== @timestamp

type: date

example: 2015-01-24 14:06:05.071000

format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ||dateOptionalTime

UTC value marking when the log payload was created, or when log payload was first collected if the creation time is not known;  this is the log processing pipeline’s “best effort” determination of when the log payload was generated FYI: the “@” prefix convention to note a field as being reserved for a particular use; in this case, most tools by default look for “@timestamp” with ElasticSearch Collected by shipshift from Jenkins, when the message was emitted.


==== geoip

type: object

geo-ip of the machine


==== hostname

type: string

FQDN of the entity generating the original payload This field is a best effort attempt to derive this context; sometimes the entity generating it knows it; other times that entity has a restricted namespace itself, and the collector or normalizer knows that


==== ipaddr4

type: ip

IP address v4 of the source server, can be an array.


==== ipaddr6

type: string

IP address v6 of the source server(if available).


==== level

type: string

example: info

Loging level as provided by: rsyslog(severitytext property), python's logging module, etc. Possible values: info, warning, notice, err, debug

==== service

type: string

name of the service. syslog's APP-NAME and programname are renamed to service field as well.


==== tags

type: string

Field contains whitespace-delimited tags or an array of tag strings. Tagging is configured on normalizers/collectors. Please note that this field is analyzed and not an array since rsyslog doesn't play well with JSON lists


=== pipeline_metadata Fields

=== collector Fields

The section contains metadata specific to the collector.



==== hostname

type: string

FQDN of the collector. It might be different from the FQDN of the actual emitter of the logs.


==== ipaddr4

type: ip

IP address v4 of the collector server, can be an array.


==== inputname

type: string

how the log message was received on the collector whether it was TCP/UDP, or maybe imjournal/imfile.


==== received_at

type: date

format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ||dateOptionalTime

Time when the message was received at the collector.


=== normalizer Fields

The section contains metadata specific to the normalizer.



==== hostname

type: string

FQDN of the normalizer.


==== ipaddr4

type: ip

IP address v4 of the normalizer server, can be an array.


==== inputname

type: string

how the log message was received on the normalizer whether it was TCP/UDP.


==== received_at

type: date

format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ||dateOptionalTime

Time when the message was received at the collector.


==== @version

type: string

==== original_raw_message

type: string

The original non-parsed log message, collected by collector or as close to the source as possible. The field is analyzed for now for troubleshooting purposes. In future we may change it to not_analyzed


==== trace

type: string

example: shipshift,<version>,2016.02.01 logstash,1.5,2016.03.03

The field records the trace of the message. Each collector/normalizer appends information about itself and the date/time when the message was processed.
