[[exported-fields]]
== Exported Fields

This document describes the fields that are exported by Com.Redhat.Viaq-Ci. They are
grouped in the following categories:

* <<exported-fields-_default_>>
* <<exported-fields-jenkins_logs>>

[[exported-fields-_default_]]
=== Common logging metadata for CI Fields

Contains common fields, corresponds to mappings of the _default_. This mapping represents generic Jenkins configuration.



==== @timestamp

type: date

example: 2015-01-24 14:06:05.071000

format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ||dateOptionalTime

UTC value marking when the log payload was created, or when log payload was first collected if the creation time is not known;  this is the log processing pipeline’s “best effort” determination of when the log payload was generated FYI: the “@” prefix convention to note a field as being reserved for a particular use; in this case, most tools by default look for “@timestamp” with ElasticSearch Collected by shipshift from Jenkins, when the message was emitted.


==== @version

type: string

example: TODO

Version of “com.redhat.viaq” mapping the document is intended to adhere to at the time of creation; this allows us to potentially migrate data from an older mapping to a new mapping if necessary (see the Logstash Jira 675 on their schema change) 


==== geoip

type: object

geo-ip of the machine


==== hostname

type: string

FQDN of the entity generating the original payload This field is a best effort attempt to derive this context; sometimes the entity generating it knows it; other times that entity has a restricted namespace itself, and the collector or normalizer knows that


==== ipaddr4

type: ip

IP address v4 of the source server, can be an array.


==== ipaddr6

type: string

IP address v6 of the source server(if available).


==== level

type: string

example: info

Loging level as provided by: rsyslog(severitytext property), python's logging module, etc. Possible values: info, warning, notice, err, debug


==== message

type: string

example: TODO

Typical log entry message, or payload, possibly stripped of metadata pulled out of it by collector/normalizer, UTF-8 encoded.


==== pid

type: string

PID of the process that emitted the log message


==== service

type: string

name of the service. syslog's APP-NAME and programname are renamed to service field as well.


==== tags

type: string

Field contains whitespace-delimited tags or an array of tag strings. Tagging is configured on normalizers/collectors. Please note that this field is analyzed and not an array since rsyslog doesn't play well with JSON lists


=== pipeline_metadata Fields

Metadata related to ViaQ log collection pipeline. Everything about log collector, normalizers goes here. Data in this subgroup is stored for troublehsooting purposes mostly.



==== inputname

type: string

how the log message was received on normalizer(?) whether it was TCP/UDP.


==== original_raw_message

type: string

The original non-parsed log message, collected by collector or as close to the source as possible. The field is analyzed for now for troubleshooting purposes. In future we may change it to not_analyzed


==== received_at

type: date

format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ||dateOptionalTime

Time at which the message was received by the normalizer (logstash in this case).


==== trace

type: string

example: shipshift,<version>,2016.02.01 logstash,1.5,2016.03.03

The field records the trace of the message. Each collector/normalizer appends information about itself and the date/time when the message was processed.


=== shipshift_metadata Fields

Placeholder for shipshift metadata. In control by shipshift team.


=== ci_master Fields

Metadata related to the master server of CI (f.e. Jenkins master).



==== hostname

type: string

FQDN of the CI master.


=== ci_agent Fields

Metadata related to the CI agent/slave that executed the job.



==== label

type: string

TODO.


==== name

type: string

TODO.


=== ci_job Fields

Metadata related to the CI job itself.



==== name

type: string

Name of the CI job.


==== build_id

type: integer

==== phase

type: string

==== status

==== log_url

type: string

==== file

type: string

name of the log file. 


==== offset

type: integer

offset of the message in the logs file. 


==== task_process

offset of the message in the logs file. 


[[exported-fields-jenkins_logs]]

==== ise_ci_branch

==== project_name

type: string
